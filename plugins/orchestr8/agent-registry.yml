# Orchestr8 Agent Registry
# Role-to-Agent mapping for intelligent agent selection
# Format: role_name -> primary agent + fallback chain + capabilities
#
# This registry enables workflows to request agents by role rather than name,
# allowing the MCP server to select the best agent based on context and
# fallback to alternatives if the primary is unavailable.
